This guide shows how to add your website as an entry to the showcase when using this plugin. All [our plugins](/resources/plugins) do use this plugin for the showcase. To clarify some terminology: When this guide talks about "the repository" or "the project", we refer to client that uses this plugin; in other words the repository, where you want to add your showcase website to.

## Preparation

In order to successfully add your website to the showcase of the project, you will need those resources:

- **Title**: The name or title of your website
- Description (optional): A short description of what your website does, what it is or how it helps people (around 15 words).
- **Image**: A thumbnail image of your website showing the content of the first page load (ideally `.png` or `.jpg`).
  This file needs to follow some requirements:
  - The dimensions of the image must be **`1280 x 720px`**
  - The file name of the image must be the domain of your website
- **URL**: The link to your website. 

## Adding the showcase entry and images

Navigate to the `/docs/src/assets/showcase/` folder inside the project. If the `showcase` folder does not exist yet, create it. Add your thumbnail image with dimensions `1280 x 720px` into this folder. The image file name must be your **domain name**.

Go to the `astro.config.{js,mjs,ts,mts}` file and search for the `starlightPluginsDocsComponents` plugin. You should find a section which either has no showcase elements yet, or already some entries configured. Append your entry to the end of the list (you might have to add the `showcaseProps.entries` array as well).

```ts title="astro.config.ts" ins={11-16}
        starlightPluginsDocsComponents({
          pluginName: "the-repository",
          showcaseProps: {
            entries: [
              {
                thumbnail: "./src/assets/showcase/example-website.png",
                href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/example-website",
                title: "Example Website",
                description: "A short description of my example website.",
              },
              {
                thumbnail: "./src/assets/showcase/<your-website>.png",
                href: "<your-link>",
                title: "<your-title>",
                description: "<your-description>",
              },
            ],
          },
        }),
      ],
```

## GitHub Resources

To make changes in the `astro.config.{js,mjs,ts,mts}` file and add images to `docs/src/assets/showcase` folder, you need to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of the repository on GitHub. Afterwards, [clone the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine, [create a new branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) (call it for example `docs-add-showcase`), change the files according to the ["Adding the showcase entry and images"](#adding-the-showcase-entry-and-images) section and then push your changes to your fork repository with these commands:

```shell
# Add all changed files in the current directory to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: add new website to showcase"

# Push the commit to the remote repository on the branch 'docs-add-showcase'
git push origin docs-add-showcase
```

You should then see the new branch you just pushed to your fork on GitHub. Now [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your new branch to the `main` branch of the original repository (our repository as defined in the [introduction](#_top) of this guide). 

Please do not be surprised that some bots will run some checks and add comments to your PR. One of them will be a preview built of the new website (the Netlify or Vercel comment) where you can double-check if your website shows up under the showcase page. You can also include the URL of this preview showcase page in your PR description if you are very enthusiastic about the addition. ðŸ™Œ A maintainer will then review the changes, so your website will be included in the production showcase soon.
