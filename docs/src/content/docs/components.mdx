title: Components
---

Here you can find a list of all the components which are exported by the `@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components` package. These components are automatically used in the three injected routes `/resources/sites`, `/resources/plugins` and `/resources/hiddeoo` but you can also use them manually.

import Preview from "../../components/component-preview.astro";

### ResourcesIntro

import ResourcesIntro from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ResourcesIntro.astro";

The `ResourcesIntro` component is used to introduce the resources section. It centralizes the management of the introduction content, so it only needs to be changed in one place.

```mdx
import ResourcesIntro from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ResourcesIntro.astro";

<ResourcesIntro />;
```

<Preview>

<ResourcesIntro />

</Preview>

### Resources

import Resources from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/Resources.astro";

The `Resources` component is used to display all resources of a specific type. The `type` property is one of the keys of the [raw JSON data](#raw-json-data).

```mdx
import Resources from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/Resources.astro";

<Resources type="plugins" />;
```

<Preview>

<Resources type="plugins" />

</Preview>

### ResourcesList

import ResourcesList from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ResourcesList.astro";

The `ResourcesList` component is used to display all resources of all types with the keys as headings. It can be useful when you want to display all resources in a list but you don't want to list all the types manually.

```mdx
import ResourcesList from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ResourcesList.astro";

<ResourcesList />;
```

<Preview>

<ResourcesList />

### ShowcaseIntro

import ShowcaseIntro from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ShowcaseIntro.astro";

The `ShowcaseIntro` component is used to introduce the showcase section. It centralizes the management of the introduction content, so it only needs to be changed in one place. Each introduction of the showcase page has its own "Call to action" text and `href` property, which is used to link to the source code of the showcase page.

```mdx
import ShowcaseIntro from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/ShowcaseIntro.astro";

<ShowcaseIntro
    cta="Have you built a website using YOUR_PLUGIN?"
    href="https://github.com/trueberryless-org/YOUR_PLUGIN/edit/main/docs/src/content/docs/showcase/sites.mdx"
/>;
```

    cta="Have you built a website using YOUR_PLUGIN?"
    href="https://github.com/trueberryless-org/YOUR_PLUGIN/edit/main/docs/src/content/docs/showcase/sites.mdx"
/>

</Preview>

### Showcase

import Showcase from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/Showcase.astro";

The `Showcase` component is used to display a list of showcase entries. These entries have to be listed manually in the `entries` property via `JSON` syntax.

```mdx
import Showcase from "@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components/components/Showcase.astro";

<Showcase
    entries={[
        {
            thumbnail: import("../../assets/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown.png"),
            href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown",
            title: "starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown",
        },
        {
            thumbnail: import("../../assets/starlight-view-modes.png"),
            href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-view-modes",
            title: "starlight-view-modes",
        },
    ]}
/>;
```

<Preview>

<Showcase
    entries={[
        {
            thumbnail: import("../../assets/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown.png"),
            href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown",
            title: "starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown",
        },
        {
            thumbnail: import("../../assets/starlight-view-modes.png"),
            href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-view-modes",
            title: "starlight-view-modes",
        },
    ]}
/>

## Raw JSON Data

import RawJsonCode from "../../components/resource-json.astro";

Here is the raw JSON data for all the components listed above. It's stored in a GitHub Gist, so that every plugin can use it. You can find the Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/trueberryless/7ed4110d6f4cf4d2517d98dfcc035705).
