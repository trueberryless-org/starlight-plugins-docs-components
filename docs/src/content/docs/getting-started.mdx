## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. `@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

    <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

    ```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        starlight({
          title: 'My Docs',
        }),
        sidebar: [
          {
            label: "Start Here",
            items: [{ slug: "getting-started" }],
          },
    +      {
    +        label: "Resources",
    +        autogenerate: { directory: "resources" },
    +      },
        ],
      ],
    })
    ```
