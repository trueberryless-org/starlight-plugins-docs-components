## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. `@trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

    <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add @trueberryless-org/starlight-plugins-docs-components
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

    ```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        starlight({
          title: 'My Docs',
    +      plugins: [
    +        starlightPluginsDocsComponents({
    +          githubOwner: "trueberryless-org", // default
    +          pluginName: "starlight-plugins-docs-components",
    +          showcaseFilepath: "./docs/astro.config.ts", // default
    +          showcaseProps: {
    +            entries: [
    +              {
    +                thumbnail: "./src/assets/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown.png",
    +                href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown",
    +                title: "Starlight Sidebar Topics Dropdown",
    +                description:
    +                    "Split your docs page into multiple subpages and switch between them with a dropdown menu in the sidebar.",
    +              },
    +              {
    +                thumbnail: "./src/assets/starlight-view-modes.png",
    +                href: "https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-view-modes",
    +                title: "Starlight View Modes",
    +                description:
    +                    "Add different view mode capabilities to your documentation website.",
    +              },
    +            ],
    +          },
    +        }),
    +      ],
        }),
      ],
    })
    ```

3. :::note
   Don't forget to add image assets to `./src/assets/`.

4. That's it! The routes will be injected automatically and the sidebar will be generated. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the plugin in action.
